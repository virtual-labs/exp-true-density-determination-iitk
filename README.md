### About the Experiment 

The density of particles, powders, and compacts is an important property affecting the performance and function of many pharmaceutical materials. By definition, all density measurements involve the measurement of mass and volume. Mass is determined with an analytical balance and the key to obtaining reliable density values is in the accuracy and precision of measuring volume.
